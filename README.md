# Lemur2Code (**WORK IN PROGRESS**)

## Project Overview
Lemur2Code is a tool designed to automatically convert UX/UI designs from Figma into code that aligns with your team's pre-defined CSS component standards. Initially built using vanilla JavaScript, the system is set to transition to Next.js. The backend leverages an Express server to interact with the Figma API, ensuring smooth integration and data handling.

## Tech Stack (**WORK IN PROGRESS**)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (with plans to migrate to Next.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Figma API**: Fetching design data and assets from Figma
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase (if necessary)
- **Other Tools**: Axios, dotenv, CORS for efficient API handling

## Features
- Convert Figma designs into reusable HTML and CSS components
- Automatically map Figma design properties (e.g., colors, typography, spacing) to team-defined CSS rules
- Backend server to handle Figma API requests securely and efficiently
- Easy to extend: Future plans to migrate to Next.js for more powerful frontend handling
